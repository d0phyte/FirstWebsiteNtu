				<h2>Support and Guidance</h2>
				<p>
				In our mentor sessions, we have the opportunity to ask course related questions and give some feedback to our mentors about our experience at NTU. I believe these are very useful as they help students adapt to university life as well as stay on track with their projects and studies.

				<h2>What skills do we need for the future?</h2>
				<p>
				This employability session gave me some insight into what employers are looking for. I learned that in addition to a strong academic background, employers require individuals with a range of core work competencies such as team working, commercial awareness and presentation skills.

				<h2>What do you aspire to be?</h2>
				<p>
				  Goal setting helps trigger new behaviors, guiding your focus and sustaining that momentum in life, as well as promoting a sense of self-mastery. In the end, you can't manage what you don't measure and you can't improve upon something you don't properly manage. These are some of the ideas I took from this workshop in digital horizons week.

				<h2>Healthy App Design Challenge</h2>
				<p>
				
				In this workshop we were faced with having to design our own healthy app and make it into something that would be useful to university students just like us. In the end apps were compared and we got to learn what choices would be the most successful. We came up with various interesting features and it was a fun time in general.

				<h2>Brain Racking Mini-Games</h2>

				In this mini-game filled room we, a group of 6 people, had to combine all of our brain power to try and solve the six riddles we found on the walls. We ended up getting through it, with some help from the very kind assistant.

				<h2>What sports do I practice in and out of NTU?</h2>
				<p>
				 
				 My main sport of choice is skateboarding, and its the sport I love most. It's a great way to relieve stress and putting in the time and effort to learn new tricks is always fun and rewarding. I've also attended a volleyball session at the city campus where I had a lots of fun and met some new people.
